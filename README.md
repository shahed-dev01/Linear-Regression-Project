# E-commerce Linear Regression Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Linear Regression model** using Python. The goal is to analyze an E-commerce company's customer dataset and decide whether they should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

## Objective
To predict the **Yearly Amount Spent** by customers based on various features such as:
- Average Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses `Ecommerce.csv`, which contains customer information (anonymized) and their spending habits.

## Conclusion
By training a Linear Regression model, we can determine which factor (App or Website) correlates most strongly with customer spending, helping the business make data-driven decisions.
